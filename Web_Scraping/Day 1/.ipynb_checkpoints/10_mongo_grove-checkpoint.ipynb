    "\n",
    "* You are the purchaser for the produce department of a large supermarket chain. You decide to use MongoDB to create a database of fruits received from your various suppliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Pymongo to create a `fruits_db` database, and a `fruits` collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Into that collection, insert two documents of fruit shipments received by your supermarket. They should contain the following information: vendor name, type of fruit, quantity received, and ripeness rating (1 for unripe, 2 for ripe, 3 for over-ripe).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because not every supermarket employee is versed in using MongoDB, your task is to build an easy-to-use app that can be run from the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a Python script that asks the user for the above information, then inserts a document into a MongoDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part III\n",
    "\n",
    "* It would be good to Modify the app so that when the record is entered, the current date and time is automatically inserted into the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hint: consult the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) on the `datetime` library.\n"
