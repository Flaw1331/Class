    "\n",
    "* The `db` implicitly refers to the currently selected database. In this specific case that means it is referring to `travel_db`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* `collectionName` should be replaced with the name of the collection that the data will be inserted into. If the named collection does not yet exist, then mongo will create it automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`db.collectionName.find().pretty()`** can then be used in order to print out the data that are stored within the named collection. The `pretty()` method prints out the data in a more readable format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* then add these :\n",
    "\n",
    "* ** `db.destinations.insert({'continent':'Europe', 'country':'France', 'major_cities':['Paris','Lyon','Toulouse']})`**\n",

    "\n",
    "* **`db.destinations.find({'continent':'africa'}).pretty()`**\n",

    "  * Lastly, explain how it is possible to find a single document by its `_id` which is a uniquely generated string that is automatically set whenever a document is made.\n",

    "\n",
    "* This activity introduces the use of the Pymongo library which allows developers to use Python to work with MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Inform students that Pymongo serves as the interface between Python and MongoDB.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * The syntax used in Pymongo is strikingly similar to that of MongoDB. As such, the learning curve for the library is quite small in comparisson to something like SQLAlchemy.\n",

    "* Open up [05-Ins_PyMongo](Activities/05-Ins_PyMongo/IntroToPymongo.py) within an IDE and work through the code line-by-line with the class, answering whatever questions students may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * After importing the PyMongo library into the application, a connection with a running instance of MongoDB must be established using `pymongo.MongoClient(connectionString)`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * As was the case with SQLAlchemy, the connection PyMongo establishes is set with a connection string. This string uses the syntax `mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Since the default localhost connection does not have a username or password set, the string for local instances of MongoDB would be `mongodb://localhost:27017`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Explain that `27017` is the default port used by MongoDB. It also happens to be a zip code in South Carolina.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![PyMongo Connection](Images/08-PyMongo_Connection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `classDB` database is assigned to the variable `db` using `client.classDB`. This tells the PyMongo client that the developer will be working inside of the `classDB` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The `db.collectionName.find({})` method creates a query that collects all of the documents within the collection named.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The query can be made more specific by adding key/value pairs into the object passed as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Inserting a document into a collection in Pymongo is similar to the process in MongoDB. Here, the only difference is the underscore used in the `insert_one()` method, in contrast to the camel case used in MongoDB's `insertOne()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Read and Create](Images/08-PyMongo_ReadCreate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Likewise, updating a document in Pymongo is similar to its counterpart in MongoDB. Again, the only difference is the underscore used in `update_one()`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Remind the class that after specifying the field with which we identify the document to be updated, the information to be updated is specified with the syntax: `{$set: {key:value}}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pushing an item into an array is similar with `$set` getting replaced with `$push` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![PyMongo Update](Images/08-PyMongo_Update.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To delete a field from a document, the `update_one({},{})` method can be used and `$unset` is passed into the second object in place of `$set`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Finally, go over how to delete a document from a collection using the `db.collectionName.delete_one({})` method where the document to delete has data matching that stored within the passed object.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * After declaring the database and the collection as `db` and `collection`, the user's input is used to set the `vendor`, `fruit_type`, `quantity`, and `ripeness` variables. These items are then inserted as key-value pairs within a dictionary.\n",
