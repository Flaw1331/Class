    <h3>Basic Version</h3>
    <b>Take a look at this json file:</b>
    <a href="https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json">https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json</a>
    <br>
    <br> Notice we have latitude and longitude, but it is not geojson data. It is just plain .json
    <br>
    <br> Notice that the response also includes other useful information, such as the `name`, `station_id`, and `capacity` of
    each bike station.
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Advanced Version</h3>
    This version groups markers into layers according to station status, e.g. "Out of Order", "Coming Soon", or "Empty".

    <br>
    <br> Using a Leaflet plugin, different custom markers are used for each status group.
    <br>
    <br> See this leaflet plugin:
    <a href="https://github.com/coryasilva/Leaflet.ExtraMarkers">https://github.com/coryasilva/Leaflet.ExtraMarkers</a>

    <br>
    <br>Similar to the first example, when a marker is clicked, a popup appears. Additionally, we see the number of bikes available
    at each station along with the station name and total capacity.
    <br>
    <br>This version of the activity uses a map legend to display quantities of markers of each status, as well as their colors
    and the last time the API was updated.
    <br>
    <br>You'll also need the <b>Citi Bike API Station Status Endpoint</b>:
    <a href="https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_status.json">https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_status.json</a>.
    <ul>
        <li>
            This endpoint provides information about the status of each bike station, including the number of bikes available and whether
            or not the station is currently installed and renting bikes.
        </li>
        <li>
            This endpoint does not, however, provide coordinates for each bike station. This must still be obtained from the first endpoint
            we discussed, the
            <b>Citi Bike API Station Information Endpoint
            </b>
                    <a href="https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json">https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The stations in both API responses have corresponding `station_id` properties. This should make it easier to match up and
            utilize data in both datasets.
        </li>
    </ul>
