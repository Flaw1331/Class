    <ul>
        <li>In this version, we are passing in a function that can style individual features based on their properties.
        </li>
        <li>If we look back at the GeoJSON we can see that each feature has the `borough` property, which can be accessed through
          `feature.properties.borough`
        </li>
        <li>
          We have written a function that uses a `switch` statement to return a different color based upon the borough that the neighborhood
          belongs to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each feature is styled using this function, so all of our boroughs will be color coded!
        </li>
      </ul>
