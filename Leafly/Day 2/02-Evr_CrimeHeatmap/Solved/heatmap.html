  Leaflet is designed to be a very light-weight and fast library and it only focuses on a core set of features. Through the use of plugins, however, we can give additional functionality to Leaflet.
  <br><br>
  Plugins are third-party libraries that integrate with Leaflet to give it additional features. We can create heat maps, map our data as a function of time, and so much more!
  <br><br>See <a href="http://Leafletjs.com/plugins.html">The Leaflet plugins</a> for more reference.
  <br><br>
   
  * Now it is time to add in our plugin! For this activity we will be using <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat">[Leaflet.Heat]</a> to make a heat map. 
  <br><br>
  * As stated in the documentation, all we have to do to use the Leaflet.heat plugin is download the `Leaflet.heat.js` file and link to it in our project's HTML file.
  <br><br>
    * The documentation tells us that we will need to create a new type of layer, a `heatLayer`, and feed it an array of points. It might be a good idea ask the students how to implement this plugin by looking at its repository. Reading and parsing documentation is an important skill for any developer!
<br><br>  
    * Instead of adding a marker to the map, we will loop through the data and push it to an array. We will feed that array of points into the `heatLayer`, along with some options, and then add it to the map.
  <br><br>
    * In the finished file, we have made some additional changes by modifying the `radius` and `blur` while also upping the record count to 10,000! According to the documentation, what other options could we have modified?
