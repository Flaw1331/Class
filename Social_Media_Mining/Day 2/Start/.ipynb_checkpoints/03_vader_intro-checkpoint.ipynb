    "### Vader Tips from http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/exploratory-data-analysis-with-nlp\n",
    "\n",
    "* The majority of sentiment analysis approaches take one of two forms: **polarity-based**, where pieces of texts are classified as either positive or negative, or **valence-based**, where the intensity of the sentiment is taken into account. For example, the words ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ would be treated the same in a polarity-based approach, whereas ‘excellent’ would be treated as more positive than ‘good’ in a valence-based approach.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Unlike other techniques that require training on related text before use, Vader is ready to go for analysis without any special setup. Vader is unique in that it makes fine-tuned distinctions between varying degrees of positivity and negative and words and features. For example, Vader scores “comfort” moderately positively and “euphoria” extremely positively. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Vader looks at punctuation. `I love it!` ranks higher than `I love it`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vader looks at caps. `I LOVE IT!` ranks higher than `I love it!`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vader looks at degree modifiers. `I effing love it` is higher than `I kinda love it`. Intensity will increase or decrease based on modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vader looks at 'but'. `I love it but it's not for me.`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vader looks at emoticons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like any text analysis tool, Vader should be evaluated critically and in the context of the assumptions it makes about communication. Vader was developed in the mid-2010s primarily for microblogging and social media (especially Twitter). Not as good with political speeches, formal emails, or books.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sentiment analysis in general has trouble with irony, sarcasm, and mockery. It also doesn't understand larger themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is more complicated, but you can update the dictionary with your own positive and negative weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vader is the tip of the iceberg of Natural Language Processing. If you are interested in this, check out the Natural Language Toolkit: http://www.nltk.org\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, great twitter analysis of Trumps tweets in R to determine which tweets come from him and which come from staffers. See: http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/. "
