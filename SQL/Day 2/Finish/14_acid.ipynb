    "  1. What happens when multiple people who share the same account are depositing or withdrawing money at the same time? How does MySQL keep track of the overall balance?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. What happens if an electrical outage takes place while a MySQL database is being updated? Some complex queries can take seconds, even minutes, to complete. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### MySQL with the Innodb engine closely follows ACID properties\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ACID model is a set of database design principles that emphasize aspects of reliability that are important for business data and mission-critical applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A **transaction** is a set of related changes which is used to achieve some of the ACID properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It stands for the following:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    * **  1. Atomicity **\n",
    "    * **  2. Consistency**\n",
    "    * **  3. Isolation**\n",
    "    * **  4. Durability **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Atomicity**: A transaction is all-or-nothing. Atomicity means that you can guarantee that all of a transaction happens, or none of it does; you can do complex operations as one single unit, all or nothing, and a crash, power failure, error, or anything else won't allow you to be in a state in which only some of the related changes have happened. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Consistency**: Means that you guarantee that your data will be consistent; none of the constraints you have on related data will ever be violated. For example, constraints such as primary keys must be met when the database is written to. In other words, a SQL transaction should be error-free, or it should not take place at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Isolation** means that one transaction cannot read data from another transaction that is not yet completed. If two transactions are executing concurrently, each one will see the world as if they were executing sequentially, and if one needs to read data that is written by another, it will have to wait until the other is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, say that a couple have a joint banking account with a balance of \\$100. If they are both withdrawing \\$20 from two different ATMs at the same time, the database needs to complete one transaction before the other. Otherwise, it may lead to a situation in which the final balance after the two transactions ends up as \\$80 rather than \\$60. (In one transaction, the ATM sees an initial balance of \\$100 and subtracts \\$20 from the balance after the withdrawal. Without isolation, if the other ATM also may see an initial balance of \\$100 and return a balance of $80 after the withdrawal.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Durability**: this means that once a transaction is saved, the data can't be lost due to occurrences like a power outage. \n",
    "\n",
    "* MySQL transactions that are ACID-compliant are enabled by storage engines, which can store transactions and protect them against events like power failure. If you run the following command in MySQL Workbench:\n"
